<div id="consent-touch" title="You touched the screen!">
  <p>It's okay!
<p>
    Not a big deal on this end, The Swamp Archive just wants to work with you to come to a mutual understanding of what that touch meant.
<p>
    Your touch is a data point which tells your device and this program what you might want them to do.
<p>
    You can think of that data as just data, but it is <i>your touch</i>, and belongs to you.
<p>
    It is your skin, your bones, the muscles in your hand, the muscles in your your eyes, your muscular memories, your desires, combined into one X/Y coordinate.
<p>
    When you touch a screen, you are sharing all of this with whatever or whoever is on the other end, listening.
<p>
    The Swamp Archive recognizes that by touching the screen, you're sharing something with it, something private.
<p>
    The Swamp Archive will not gossip.
<p>
    The Swamp Archive will treat your touch like a whispered conversation.
<p>
    Do you consent to touching?</p></div>

  <div id="consent-touch-no" title="That's okay!">
    <p>Sorry, we had to hear your touch for a moment to know that you wanted us to stop listening. We've stopped now, but don't worry, we can still show you an image! All you have to do is look. Keep watching. Be patient. </p></div>

  <div id="consent-see" title="Your eyes...">
    <p>
    Thank you for trusting the Swamp Archive. This program will continue to work to earn and keep your trust.
<p>
    Now, let's rewind a bit -- back on the homepage, you pressed the "retrieve" button.
<p>
    The Swamp Archive cannot assume you pressed the button on purpose -- it doesn't know you or what you want.
<p>
    By clicking "retrieve" you (whether you meant to or not) asked the Swamp Archive to retrieve an image of a swamp.
<p>
    All the swamp images are just this -- still images of beautiful swamps.
<p>
    All of these swamps are under the Public Domain Liscence, meaning the owner/creator of the image has waived all rights to their image under Copyright law, making the image free to be
    <ul>
    <li>copied (something you can do, if you wish)
    <li>modified (also something you can do!)
    <li>distributed (this is what the Archive doing)
    <li>or performed (this is what you and this program are doing together)
    </ul>
    all without asking permission.
<p>
    By placing their image in the public domain, the owner/creator of each image has consented to the use of their work for any purpose.
<p>
    The Swamp Archive wants to give you the golden opportunity to lay your eyes on some miry, marshy, boggy, sodden swamps.
<p>
    Do you consent to seeing?</p>
</div>

<div id="consent-see-no" title="That's okay!">
  <p>
All good. We have some more options for you -- if you would like to see something else, you could visit the Swamp Archive info page to learn more about the Archive. You also have the option of hearing a swamp image, giving us access to your ears. Sounds have been known to move listeners to all kinds of states -- sorrow, trepidation, glory, elation -- all are possible, and it really depends on the person and the sound. This sound is simply a 4 minute recording from the Pantanal swamp in Brazil taken by someone who placed their recording in the Public Domain Liscence. There are no sudden volume changes or changes in the content of the sound. Would you like to hear a Swamp image?</p>
</div>

<div id="consent-save" title="You've got a browser!">
  <p>
  Nice.
<p>
  As stated earlier, you can save and use these pictures for anything --
  <ul>
  <li>a gift for your buddies in a group chat
  <li>a canvas to doodle some poetry on
  <li>your new device wallpaper
  <li>print it out and wallpaper your brother's new apartment!
  </ul>
<p>
  Your broswer is going to help out both you and the Swamp Archive by letting you save your swamp image.
<p>
  It's a pretty simple process, one you might already be used to -- just hold your finger down long enough on the image for options to appear, click "save," and it's yours.
<p>
  To make this happen, your browser needs access to your photo gallery.
<p>
  The Swamp Archive thinks that this is kind of a big ask. Your photo gallery is probably pretty important to you, and pretty personal.
<p>
  The Swamp Archive also knows it's pretty likely you've already given your browser this permission.
<p>
  When you download an app, it usually pops up boxes (kind of like these) asking for your consent in different ways.
<p>
  An app might ask if it can track where you are in the world while you're using it, listen to you when you're talking to your friends and not using it, or save pictures to your device's gallery when you ask it to.
<p>
  All of these conversations you've had with these apps are saved in your settings for you to review and change if you'd like.
<p>
  If you haven't given your browser access to your gallery, you can do so in your settings.
<p>
  If you don't want to give your browser access to your gallery, you don't have to! Simply take a screenshot using your device to save the picture (your browser will never know!). </p>
</div>

<div id="no-gaurantees" title="Coming clean...">
  <p>
    In reality, you and the Swamp Image Archive are not talking privately.
  <p>
    You're playing a really long game of telephone -- I'm talking through the Swamp Archive, the Swamp Archive is talking to the browser, your browser is talking to your device, your device is talking to a modem, who is talking to a router, who is talking to a bunch of servers all over the world in order to finally get to you.
  <p>
    This isn't even a very accurate descriptions of all the levels of exchanging information involved in getting these words to show up in front of you. It's incredible, but can also be worrisome -- because there are so many people and steps involved, there are things the Swamp Archive just can't guarantee.
  <p>
You and the Swamp Archive are whispering in a room full of microphones which may or may not be turned on and may or may not be recording.
  <p>
    We don't say this to scare you. You certainly shouldn't feel guilty or responsible for this potential lack of privacy.
    It isn't your fault for using technology to communicate -- it's one of the main features of most accessible forms of technology.
  <p>
    This isn't coincidental -- people created and regulate these various technologies and systems for communication <i>with</i> and <i>for</i> other people.
  <p>
    It's okay to trust these pieces of technology.
  <p>
    What isn't okay is when those who have created these technologies exploit your body, memories, wants, needs, conversations, touches, etc. for any means except those YOU have agreed to and understand.
  <p>
    You can't know everything about these technologies. You can't even know everything about The Swamp Archive or its true intensions. Sometimes, all you can do is trust the information being given to you. </p>
</div>

<div id="what-we-can-gaurantee" title="But!">
  <p>
  Everyone is in the same boat. All of this stuff doesn't mean you should stop using technology -- it's a powerful, useful, and incredible tool!

  Here are some things you can do to at least <i>feel</i> safer:
  <ul>
  <li>try your best to understand what is being asked of you in terms of service agreements, when apps ask for permissions to be granted, etc.
  <li>value your own privacy, agency, and autonomy (you should be in charge and in control of you)
   <li>expect and demand <i>others</i> value and respect the privacy, agency, and autonomy of yourself AND OTHERS!
  </ul>
<p>
  This is all easier said than done and, as stated before, these problems are not completely your responsibility.
<p>
  Your data is important and it is an extension of you, but you are not data. You know that. Those who have access and control to your data should too.

<p>
  The Swamp Archive wants to acknowledge, validate, and value your personhood by respecting your boundaries and your intentions. It will not to make assumptions about who you are or what you want, and will be sure to ask when it isn't sure -- not once, but continously and without any consequence, should your request change over time.
<p>
  Knowing this, and knowing there is only one step left, do you want to view a swamp image?</p>
</div>


<div id="final-overview" title="Last Step">
  <p>
  Last, but not least, let's go over what we've agreed to:
  <ul>
    <li>you can use your skin to talk to me</li>
    <li>the Swamp Archive can listen for your touch</li>
    <li>you can use your optic nerves to transform light into electric impulses</li>
    <li>The Swamp Archive can show you an image of a swamp when you ask</li>
    <li>you can view/share/copy/change any swamp images you recieve</li>
    <li>you can change your mind</li>
  </ul>
